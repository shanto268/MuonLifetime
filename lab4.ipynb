    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we observe cosmic\n",
    "muons. Cosmic rays are high energy particles produced in the sun and in supernovae\n",
    "and neutron stars of our galaxy. About\n",
    "$85\\%$ of the cosmic rays are protons and\n",
    "$12\\%$ are alpha particles (helium nuclei).\n",
    "The remainder are electrons and nuclei of\n",
    "heavier atoms. The cosmic rays travel in\n",
    "the space between the stars. In their path\n",
    "they interact with atomic nuclei and they\n",
    "produce new cosmic rays, like antiprotons,\n",
    "positrons, photons and neutrinos. The\n",
    "cosmic rays that reach our atmosphere are\n",
    "called primary cosmic rays. The energy\n",
    "spectrum of primary cosmic rays, i.e. the\n",
    "number of particles as a function of energy, has been measured over an enormous\n",
    "range. For the nuclear component, it is\n",
    "shown in Figure 1. A good fit to the data,\n",
    "except at the lowest energies, is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I(E) ∝ E^{-2.6} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $I(E)$ is the intensity (flux) of the nuclear component at energy $E$.\n",
    "When a primary cosmic ray, e.g. a proton, enters the Earth’s atmosphere it interacts with the nuclei of the atmosphere’s atoms (mainly oxygen and nitrogen). From the interactions, new particles are produced (secondary cosmic rays ), inducing in their turn new reactions with atoms\n",
    "of the atmosphere. This creates a hadronic shower. The word *hadronic*\n",
    "signifies that the produced particles are hadrons, i.e. strongly interacting particles, like protons, pions, kaons, etc. The word *shower* refers\n",
    "to the way the particle production develops in space (see Figure 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Antiparticles, like antiprotons,\n",
    "are also produced in this process.\n",
    "Unstable hadrons then decay weakly\n",
    "to electrons, muons and neutrinos.\n",
    "Photons are also produced, e.g. by\n",
    "$\\pi^0 $ decays or electron bremsstrahlung.\n",
    "Electromagnetic showers are created\n",
    "by electrons or by photons converting\n",
    "into electron-positron pairs, which\n",
    "emit new photons etc. Overall, a very\n",
    "high energy proton can produce a\n",
    "very extensive shower, covering many\n",
    "$km^2$ of the Earth’s surface. By the\n",
    "time the showers reach the ground,\n",
    "they mainly consist of electron- and\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mu^- \\rightarrow + v_{\\mu} + \\bar{v}_{e} + e^-$$\n",
    "$$\\mu^+ \\rightarrow + v_{e} + \\bar{v}_{\\mu} + e^+$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the muons decay in the atmosphere but some have high enough energies to reach our detector. Depending on their energy, they will either go through\n",
    "it or stop in the aluminium plate, which is located in the middle of the detector\n",
    "(Figure 4), where they will eventually decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lifetime of a particle: \n",
    "\n",
    "The lifetime of a particle is something that we define in the rest frame of\n",
    "the particle. For the purposes of this lab, we will take the muon as an example of the decaying particle.\n",
    "If we take a muon and observe it in its rest frame, we can never tell in advance\n",
    "at exactly which moment the muon will decay, even if we know exactly when the\n",
    "muon was created. This means that the muon does not have a fixed time of life.\n",
    "The only thing that we can say is that at a specific moment in time, t, there is a\n",
    "probability, $P(t)$, for the muon to decay (i.e. has a statistical nature)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that, at time $t_0 = 0$, we have $N_0$ muons. Each one of them has\n",
    "the same probability to decay in a specific time interval. For example, in the interval $[t_0, t_0 + 10 ns]$, each muon will have a probability $P_1$ to decay. It is convenient\n",
    "to define the decay probability per unit time, $\\lambda$, which is a constant. We can now find the decay probability for any time interval $dt$: this will be equal to $\\lambda dt$, as\n",
    "we can check from the units of the variables $\\lambda$ and $dt$ $([probability/time]x[time])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the number of muons has decreased by a quantity\n",
    "$dN = −N(t) \\lambda dt$ . The minus sign is there because $dN = N_{final} − N_{initial} < 0$. If\n",

    "right through the detector, however a fraction is stopped in the\n",
    "aluminium absorber, where they\n",
    "will decay. The muons (blue) come\n",

    "scintillators (TC and C1) before they stop (absorber). The positron (green/golden)\n",

    "controlled through the use of a magnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Scintillators\n",
    "\n",
    "Scintillators are devices that detect the passage of charged particles. Our\n",
    "scintillators are made of plastic. When a charged particle passes through the\n",
    "scintillator it excites (gives energy to) the molecules of the scintillator. Soon\n",
    "afterwards the molecules emit light and return to their ground state. A single\n",
    "charged particle will typically cause around $20000$ photons to be emitted per $cm$ of traversed scintillator. The scintillators are so called because the light which\n",
    "is emitted from their molecules is a scintillation, i.e., a small flash of light. The\n",
    "emitted light is directed to the photomultiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Photomultipliers\n",
    "\n",
    "A photomultiplier is mounted after each\n",
    "scintillator and collects the light that was\n",
    "emitted by the molecules of the scintillator.\n",
    "The function of the photomultiplier is to\n",
    "convert the light to an electric pulse (analog\n",
    "signal). This is done as follows: the incoming light (photons) hit a photocathode (a\n",
    "piece of material at a negative electric potential). $10$ to $30\\%$ of the photons cause\n",
    "the emission of an electron (photoelectric\n",
    "effect). The electrons are accelerated between a series of dynodes (pieces of metal\n",
    "at increasingly positive electric potentials).\n",
    "When an electron hits a dynode, $5$ new electrons are emitted from the dynode. As the\n",
    "electrons traverse the dynodes, an avalanche\n",
    "of electrons is produced. Finally, all electrons are collected at the anode, where their\n",
    "initial number has been multiplied by a factor $10^6$ or more. This is the pulse (analog\n",
    "signal) that we obtain from the photomultiplier. The photomultiplier is so called because it takes originally light (photo-) that\n",
    "converts to electrons which it multiplies (in\n",
    "the dynodes).\n",

    "### Discriminators\n",
    "\n",
    "A discriminator is a device which converts analog to digital (0 or 1) signals as\n",

    "is given as input to the discriminator,\n",
    "the discriminator will produce a digital\n",
    "pulse C because the signal A exceeds the\n",
    "threshold of the discriminator. A low signal B which is smaller than the threshold,\n",
    "will be ignored and the discriminator will\n",

    "## Day 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "We went to the physics building (RM 030) and were looking at the scintillator counters, power supply and the DAQ system next to it. We turned on the power supply for the PMTs connected to the scintillators without changing the configuration that the last group has devised out of curiosity to see the signals on the oscilloscope. Instantly, we realized that there was some significant light leak as the pulse generated by the PMT was almost constant - a rate that is simply not representative of muon hits at this elevation on the scintillation area. \n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Discuss your setup. Write down exactly how you elect to set thresholds and the electronic logic for event selection.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The set up has been described in **Section 2.4**, the electronic logic is explained in **Section 2.4.5**. To determine the thresholds we fixed the PMT voltage and vary the threshold while observing the signals through the oscilloscope. Thus, we determine the threshold value experimentally (i.e. the value at which we no longer see the electronic noise and see both muons and the occasional positron from muon decay on the scope).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Plot the time distribution and calculate the muon life-time by making a fit. How good is the fit? What are the errors on your fit parameters? Statistical and systematic? Identify each source of error.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiment did not rely on the conventional means of curve fitting to find the muon life-time. So, we can't make any comments on the fit parameters. However, we did have many sources of error in our measurement - light leaks in scintillator-PMT systems were a systematic source of error, there were also statistical errors due to the relatively short sample of events we used to make our measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Assuming muons are created 30 km above sea-level and travel at the speed of light, what is the minimum time they must survive to be seen in your experiment?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given, $d = 30 km = 30000 m $ and $v_\\mu = c m/s$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{d}{v_\\mu} \\sim 100 \\mu s$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.What is the maximum energy the decay electron can have? What distance such an electron travel in the scintillator? How many photons does it generate? Can we measure (or estimate) their energies with our setup? How about the neutrinos?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most energetic muon decay involves the two neutrinos being emitted in the same direction and the electron recoiling. By treating the neutrinos as massless we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$pc + \\sqrt{m_e^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2} = m_\\mu c^2 \\$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be solved for $p$ and the maximum electron energy found directly. From literature review, I found the value to be $53 MeV$. The number of photons it generates can be found by the following relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E = N\\hbar f $\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, N is the number of photons that are generated with scintillation light frequency of $f$. We can measure their energy through our set up by passing the PMT output to an ADC module. We cannot measure the energy of the neutrinos in our set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What are the possible sources of backgrounds?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible sources of background are light emitting sources such as bulbs and computer screens. There is also a nearby HVAC system that may also discharge time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Compare your result with the accepted value (check http://pdg.lbl.gov). Explain the differences, if any**\n",
    "\n",
    "The website has the accepted value of the muon life-time to be $2.1969811 \\pm 0.0000022 \\mu s$. The percentage difference between this value and our measurement is $1.7 \\%$. Our value is thus accurate within the $2\\%$ significance level. The reason for a non-exact value is due to various systematic and statistical errors that we explain in question 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Muons come in two different charge states, positive and negative. The negative muon decays $\\mu^- \\rightarrow + v_{\\mu} + \\bar{v}_{e} + e^-$ and the positive one as $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow + v_{e} + \\bar{v}_{\\mu} + e^+$ . Can you tell which type of muons you detected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "With our current set up (with the magnet not in use), we cannot distinguish between which types of muons we detect. \n",
    "\n",
    "**8. What is lepton number conservation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The conservation of lepton number means that whenever a lepton of a certain generation is created or destroyed in a reaction, a corresponding antilepton from the same generation must be created or destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. How do we know there are two neutrinos in muon decay? Why not just one or none? How can we experimentally answer this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Muon decay are similar to Beta decay. There is weak interaction that makes use of an intermediate vector boson ($W$). The primary muon decays into a neutrino and a $W$ boson. The $W$ boson then further disintegrates into another neutrino and an electron/positron. This is why there is always two neutrinos in a muon decay. The flavor of the neutrino and whether an electron or positron is generated depends on the parity of the muon. Experimentally we can answer this by including a magnet in our set up and setting it up such that the generated positron is always sent to a distinct counter and the electron in the other. Of course, the material of the absorber in this experiment should be chosen such that it allows the muon to decay but doesn't trap any generated electrons. The detection of this electron/positron is proof of this mode of decay of electron and is thus an experimental answer to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another experiment, would be to just have \"neutrino detectors\" enveloping the absorber. For events where we detect a positron in the scintillators we count the the number of neutrinos in the \"neutrino detectors\". We should see the answer to be 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Are there other muon decay modes? If so, what are they? Can we detect/identify them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Other muon decay modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu^- \\rightarrow \\gamma + e^-$$\n",
    "$$\\mu^- \\rightarrow e^- + e^+ + e^-$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, they do not involve neutrinos and thus violate the lepton flavor conservation. These modes are prohibited and therefore cannot be detected."
